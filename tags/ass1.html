    <h2>Data Structure Elemets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Array</h3>
            <p>
                An <mark>Array</mark> is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
                The idea is to <b><i>store multiple items of the same type together.</i></b>
                This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply
                adding an offset to a base value, i.e., <span style="color:red">
                    the memory location of the first element
                     of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).</span>
               </p>
        
           </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Stack</h3>
            
              <p>  <span style="color:red">Stacks are a type of container adaptor,
                specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context
                (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.</span></p>
           
            <p>
                <mark>Stack</mark> are implemented as container adaptors, which are classes that use an
                encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a
                specific set of member functions to access its elements. Elements are pushed/popped from the
                "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.

                The underlying container may be any of the standard container class templates or
                some other specifically designed container class. The container shall support the following operations:
                <ul>
                    <li>empty</li>
                    <li>size</li>
                    <li>back</li>
                    <li>push_back</li>
                    <li>pop_back</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
          

        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Linked List</h3>
            <p>
                <span style="color:red">Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.
                Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location;
                the elements are linked using pointers.</span>
            </p>

            <b>Why Linked List?</b>
            <p>Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on
                    the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory
                    is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room
                    has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.
                </li>
            </ol>
            

        </li>
    </ul>
