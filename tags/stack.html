        <h3><b><dt>LIFO STACK</dt></b></h3>
        <dd>
            Stacks are a type of container adaptor,
            specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context
            (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
        </dd>

        <p>
            <mark>Stack</mark>are implemented as container adaptors, which are classes that use an
            encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a
            specific set of member functions to access its elements. Elements are pushed/popped from the
            "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.

            The underlying container may be any of the standard container class templates or
            some other specifically designed container class. The container shall support the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>empty</li>
                <li>size</li>
                <li>back</li>
                <li>push_back</li>
                <li>pop_back</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
