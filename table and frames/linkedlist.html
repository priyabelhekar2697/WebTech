            Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.
            Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location;
            the elements are linked using pointers.
        </dd>

        <b>Why Linked List?</b>
        <dd>Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.</dd>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on
                the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory
                is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room
                has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.
            </li>
