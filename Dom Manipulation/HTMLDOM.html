            Set up in 1988, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)
            is a scientific society of the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government
            of India, carrying out Research and Development (R&D) in IT, electronics and associated areas.
            Different thematic areas of C-DAC's research include high performance computing, grid and
            cloud computing, multilingual computing, professional electronics, software technologies,
            cyber security, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and education & training.
        </p>

        <p name="n1">
            As an institution for high-end R&D, C-DAC has been at the forefront
            of the IT revolution in the country, constantly building capacities in emerging/enabling
            technologies, and innovating and leveraging its expertise, calibre and skill sets to develop
            and deploy IT products and solutions for diverse sectors. It has resulted in the emergence
            of a high-quality intellectual resource base at C-DAC in the form of expert teams with specialised
            knowledge of various facets of advanced computing.
        </p>

        <p name="n1">
            With such a rich resource base at its command, C-DAC set up the Advanced
            Computing Training School (ACTS) in 1993 to meet the ever-increasing skilled manpower requirements
            of the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) industry as well as supplement its intellectual
            resource base for cutting-edge research and development. Over the years C-DAC has designed and
            delivered various postgraduate and undergraduate degree and diploma programmes. In addition, C-DAC
            imparts ICT training to state and national governments and agencies, strategic sectors, corporate and
            industries, foreign countries and international students, based on specific requirements.
        </p>

        <p name="n1">
            Presently C-DAC is offering postgraduate diploma courses through its training
            centres located in cities such as Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur,
            Karad, Kochi, Kolkata, Mohali, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik, New Delhi, Noida, Pune, and Thiruvananthapuram.
            Each year, thousands of students and professionals are trained at these centres, enhancing their knowledge-
            base and equipping them with the latest methodologies in advanced computing so as to make their mark in the
            ICT industry. So far more than 3 lakh students have passed out from C-DAC. Many of them are successful employees
            of multi-national and premier Indian ICT companies today, and many more have become booming entrepreneurs.
        </p>

        <p name="n1">
            C-DAC is committed to nation building and is the first Indian government agency
            that has expanded its training horizons globally, extending its high quality training services to countries
            like Armenia, Belarus, Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Dubai, Ghana, Grenada, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lesotho,
            Mauritius, Myanmar, Peru, Seychelles, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.
