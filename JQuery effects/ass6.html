        <p>
            An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements.
            Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string.
            Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

            For example, a search engine may use an array to store Web pages found in a search
            performed by the user. When displaying the results, the program will output one element of
            the array at a time. This may be done for a specified number of values or until all the values
            stored in the array have been output. While the program could create a new variable for each result
            found, storing the results in an array is much more efficient way to manage memory.

        <h1>Linked List <button id="c2" style="float:right">?</button></h1>
        <p>
            In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is
            not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a
            data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form,
            each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure
            allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex
            variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked
            lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have
            better cache locality compared to linked lists.

        <h1>Stack <button id="c3" style="float:right">?</button></h1>
        <p>
            In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

            push, which adds an element to the collection, and
            pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
            The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).
            Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.[1] The name "stack"
            for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other.
            This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the
            stack may require taking off multiple other items first.[2]

            Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations
            occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. This data structure makes it possible
            to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element. A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity.
            If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is
            then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack.

            A stack is needed to implement depth-first search.
