        <h2><b><u><a id="basic">What is Exception</a> </u></b></h2><br>


        <p>
            An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
            A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running,
            such as an attempt to divide by zero.

            Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
            C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.

        </p>

        <h3><b><a id="throw">Throw</a></b></h3>
        <p>
            A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.

            Exceptions can be thrown anywhere within a code block using throw statement. The operand of
            the throw statement determines a type for the exception and can be any expression and the type of
            the result of the expression determines the type of exception thrown.
        </p>

        <h3><b><a id="catch">Catch</a></b></h3>
        <p>
            A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you
            want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
        </p>

        <h3><b><a id="try">try</a></b></h3>
        <p>
            A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated.
            It's followed by one or more catch blocks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Assuming a block will raise an exception, a method catches an exception using a
            combination of the try and catch keywords. A try/catch block is placed around the code that might
            generate an exception.
