    <p>
        namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the 
        identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it.
        Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name 
        collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.
        All identifiers at namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification.
        Identifiers outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name 
        for each identifier, for example std::vector<std::string> vec;, or else by a using
        Declaration for a single identifier (using std::string), or a using Directive for all 
        the identifiers in the namespace (using namespace std;). Code in header files should always
        use the fully qualified namespace name.
