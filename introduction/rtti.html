    <h2> <b><u>RTTI </u></b></h2><br>
    <p>
       In C++, RTTI (Run-time type information) is a mechanism that exposes information about an 
        object’s data type at runtime and is available only for the classes which have at least one
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution

       For example, dynamic_cast uses RTTI and following program fails with error “cannot dynamic_cast `b’
        (of type `class B*’) to type `class D*’ (source type is not polymorphic) ” because there is no virtual 
        function in the base class B.
