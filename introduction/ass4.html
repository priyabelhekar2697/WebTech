    <h2> <b><u><a id="oop">What is OOP</a> </u></b></h2><br>
    <p>
        Object-oriented programming: As the name suggests,
        Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming.
        Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc
        in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them
        so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
    </p>

    <h2><b><u><a id="namespace">What is Namaspace</a> </u></b></h2><br>
    <p>
        namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the
        identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it.
        Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name
        collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.
        All identifiers at namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification.
        Identifiers outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name
        for each identifier, for example std::vector<std::string>
            vec;, or else by a using
            Declaration for a single identifier (using std::string), or a using Directive for all
            the identifiers in the namespace (using namespace std;). Code in header files should always
            use the fully qualified namespace name.
    </p>

    <h2><b><u><a id="Exception">What is Exception</a> </u></b></h2><br>


    <p>
        An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
        A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running,
        such as an attempt to divide by zero.

        Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
        C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.

    </p>

    <h3><b><u>throw</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.

        Exceptions can be thrown anywhere within a code block using throw statement. The operand of
        the throw statement determines a type for the exception and can be any expression and the type of
        the result of the expression determines the type of exception thrown.
    </p>

    <h3><b><u>catch</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you
        want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
    </p>

    <h3><b><u>try</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated.
        It's followed by one or more catch blocks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Assuming a block will raise an exception, a method catches an exception using a
        combination of the try and catch keywords. A try/catch block is placed around the code that might
        generate an exception.
    </p>

    <h3> <b><u><a id="rtti">RTTI</a></u></b></h3><br>
    <p>
        In C++, RTTI (Run-time type information) is a mechanism that exposes information about an
        object’s data type at runtime and is available only for the classes which have at least one
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution

        For example, dynamic_cast uses RTTI and following program fails with error “cannot dynamic_cast `b’
        (of type `class B*’) to type `class D*’ (source type is not polymorphic) ” because there is no virtual
        function in the base class B.
