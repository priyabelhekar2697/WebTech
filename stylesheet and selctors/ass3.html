          <p>  Yoga is an old discipline from India. It is both spiritual and physical. Yoga uses breathing techniques, 
            exercise and meditation. It helps to improve health and happiness. Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union.
            Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga. He defined yoga as "the cessation of the modification of the mind" (stopping changing the mind).

            A person doing yoga will move from one posture (called asana) to another. For example, the "sun-salutation"
            contains 12 poses of asanas, one after the other, and is said to help balance body and soul. There is a specific mantra 
            for each asana. The "sun-salutation" is popularly known as "Suryanamaskar".
